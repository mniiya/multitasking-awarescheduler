- created bare-bone android app
- supports Android sdk version 8 - 17 (2.2 Froyo - 4.3 Jellybean)
- not sure what to name app, we can always change it later.
- currently looking at how to implement alarm/wake feature, someone might want to look at how to read/write data

- recreated android app which should be an extension of the AWARE framework.  hopefully…
- you will need to import the aware framework into the project along with the project folder, Eclipse should recognize "aware_framework_v2" as a library.  don't modify the components within that folder, the stuff in "Survey" is based off "aware framework".
- updated to support Android sdk version 2.3 - 4.4
- what it is supposed to do currently is to show as a new plugin for AWARE, which should be toggle-able, but does nothing at the moment except to show itself turning on or off when toggled by user.  i think.  still trying to figure out how to run it on my emulator and my phone.
- Devin i would recommend that for now, figure out how to get the read/write part working as a separate android app/project.  That app could just have some sort of text field that the user can see a question (retrieved from the file), and answer into a text box (to be stored in a file).  and then check if the file is created and formatted correctly.  Reason i'm recommending this is that when problems arise for the parts we're working on, it won't break the other persons' code if we were working on separate projects for the separate parts.  Once the parts we're working on work, we can then fuse the whole project together and start testing/debugging.

- ESM should show up, along with the phone vibrating to indicate that a ESM has popped up
- This will only work once, to restart it, you would have to disable and re-enable the plugin to get it to reinitialize.
- still can’t get the alarm manager to work, even in a separate project.  currently in this project there is no alarm manager thing to set when the ESM shows up.  would be great if someone figured out what I did wrong so i can start implementing the ESM times in.

- All 6 ESMs should display on startup.  But number 2 shows the range separately, while number 3 has it in star form with the graphical errors.  The graphics do not seem to be modifiable.
- Alarm functionality is in the code, however I don’t know if it works.  Feel free to try it out.
- Let me know if the project does not seem to run because of some error, I just copied and replaced everything from my renamed project folder into the folder in github.
